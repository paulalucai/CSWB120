This website appeals the most to my desired design aesthetic. The most useful use (hehe, "useful use") of Javascript is on the page that I've linked above; it's a simple image slider that includes a barely-noticeable image-loading bar at the top of the content section, and the images roll up like a little elevator. 

I also really like that the content is contained within a minimally-styled square section that is centered in the middle of the page. The page reloads quickly and in a subtle way, where you can barely notice any changes besides the images and the header title. I believe that has something to do with jQuery or AJAX? :)
